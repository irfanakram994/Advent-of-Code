# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 - Solutions by Irfan Ali

Welcome to my repository for **Advent of Code 2024** — an annual programming challenge hosted by [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). This repo contains my personal solutions for the first **14 days** of this year's event.

## 📅 What is Advent of Code?

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. It's a great way to improve problem-solving skills and have fun with code during December.
